## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

This Code of Conduct also applies to behavior outside the community spaces when the Project Stewards have a reasonable belief that an individual's behavior may have a negative impact on the community or its members.

## Reporting Guidelines

### How to Report
If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it by contacting the project team at [project-email@example.com]. All reports will be handled with discretion.

### What to Include
When reporting, please include:
- Your contact information
- Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved
- Your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing
- The date and time of the incident
- Any additional information that may be helpful

### Confidentiality
All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident. We will keep your identity confidential unless you explicitly give us permission to share it.

## Enforcement Process

### Investigation
1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of the report within 24 hours
2. **Investigation**: We will investigate the reported incident thoroughly and fairly
3. **Decision**: We will make a decision based on the evidence and community standards
4. **Communication**: We will communicate the outcome to all relevant parties

### Possible Consequences
Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

#### 1. Correction
**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### 2. Warning
**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban
**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

#### 4. Permanent Ban
**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Appeals Process

If you believe you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the project team with a concise description of your grievance. Appeals will be handled by a different set of community leaders than those who made the original decision.
